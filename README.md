# Health Protocol Hackathon
Project Overview
Decentralized Health Risk Protocol is a blockchain-based health insurance system that automates claim processing with borderless coverage. Patients can submit medical claims from anywhere in the world, making it ideal for travelers, international students, and workers on short-term assignments. Approved hospitals can review claims through secure role-based access control on Ethereum.

Hackathon Progress
Built during the hackathon with Solidity 0.8.28 and Hardhat. Features include complete claim management, role-based access control, comprehensive testing, and testnet deployment configuration.
